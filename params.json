I have designed and developed a 100 million page web crawler, recommender systems, a program for detecting \"spikes\" and related queries in search engine logs and a text miner for definitions from web pages.\r\n\r\n## Sample Creations\r\n\r\n### Recommender Systems\r\n\r\nExample of recommended \"similar items\" overlaid over a StackOverflow question:\r\n\r\n![StackoverFlow Recommender Screenshot](../images/stackoverflow-similar-items.png)\r\n\r\nThis screenshot shows a set of \"similar items\" being recommended for a given web page. I designed and implemented an algorithm which combines information from multiple sources, such as \"co-clicks\", \"related clicks\", \"related results\" etc. For more details, please see the [Funnelback Recommender System Documentation](http://docs.funnelback.com/recommendations.html).\r\n\r\n## Key Skills\r\n* Information Retrieval & Search\r\n* Data Mining\r\n* Analytics\r\n* Distributed Systems\r\n* NoSQL\r\n* Relational Databases\r\n* API Design\r\n* Java\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n* M.Sc. in Information Retrieval, [Dublin City University](http://dcu.ie/computing/index.shtml) (1996 - 1998)\r\n* B.Sc. in Computer Applications, Dublin City University (1992 - 1996)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n* Email: francis.crimmins @ gmail.com\r\n* LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscrimmins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscrimmins)\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis is a personal site and so the content here is my own and does not necessarily reflect the viewpoint or opinions of my current or previous employers.
