{"name":"Francis Crimmins","tagline":"I am a senior software engineer that specialises in combining ideas from the research and open source worlds to create new products and systems.","body":"## Summary\r\nI have designed and developed a 100 million page web crawler, recommender systems, a program for detecting \"spikes\" and related queries in search engine logs and a text miner for definitions from web pages.\r\n\r\n## Portfolio\r\n\r\n### Recommender Systems\r\nExample of recommended \"similar items\" overlaid over a StackOverflow question:\r\n\r\n![StackoverFlow Recommender Screenshot](../images/stackoverflow-similar-items.png)\r\n\r\nI designed and implemented an algorithm which combines information from multiple sources, such as \"co-clicks\", \"related clicks\", \"related results\" etc. For more details, please see the [Funnelback Recommender System Documentation](http://docs.funnelback.com/recommendations.html).\r\n\r\n### Query Spikes and Related Queries\r\n\r\n![Query spikes and related queries screenshot](../images/query-spikes-and-related-queries.png)\r\n\r\nI was the original design of the Funnelback \"Pattern Analyser\" system, which can detect \"[spikes](http://docs.funnelback.com/pattern_analyser_reports.html)\" in particular queries (usually due to some external temporal event). I also designed and implemented a system to automatically detect related queries, based on their click patterns. This can be used to group queries which have no terms in common but have the same semantics.\r\n\r\n### Web Crawling and Graph Analysis\r\nExample visualization of a web crawl:\r\n\r\n![Graph visualisation](../images/website-graph.png)\r\n\r\nI was the original creator of the Funnelback web crawler, which was designed to minimise resource usage (memory, storage etc.) while crawling 100s of millions of web pages. I have also done work on analysing crawl link graphs and how \"annotations\" like queries, clicks and anchortext can be used to enrich the dataset for other applications (including Analytics and Data Mining).\r\n\r\n## Key Skills\r\n* Information Retrieval & Search\r\n* Data Mining\r\n* Analytics\r\n* Distributed Systems\r\n* NoSQL\r\n* Relational Databases\r\n* API Design\r\n* Java\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n* M.Sc. in Information Retrieval, [Dublin City University](http://dcu.ie/computing/index.shtml) (1996 - 1998)\r\n* B.Sc. in Computer Applications, Dublin City University (1992 - 1996)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n* Email: francis.crimmins @ gmail.com\r\n* LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscrimmins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscrimmins)\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis is a personal site and does not necessarily reflect the viewpoint or opinions of my current or previous employers.
