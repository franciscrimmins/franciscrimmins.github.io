<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>I have designed and developed a 100 million page web crawler, recommender systems, a program for detecting "spikes" and related queries in search engine logs and a text miner for definitions from web pages.</p>

<p>I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://funnelback.com/">Funnelback</a> in Canberra, and prior to that was a Research Engineer at Australia's national research agency, the <a href="http://csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>.</p>

<a name="portfolio" class="anchor" href="#portfolio"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Portfolio</h2>

<p>All of the systems or features shown in this portfolio were self-initiated, designed and implemented by me, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>Example of recommended "similar items" overlaid over a StackOverflow question:</p>

<p><img src="../images/stackoverflow-similar-items.png" alt="StackoverFlow Recommender Screenshot"></p>

<p>I designed and implemented an algorithm which combines information from multiple sources, such as "co-clicks", "related clicks", "related results" etc. For more details, please see the <a href="http://docs.funnelback.com/recommendations.html">Funnelback Recommender System Documentation</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../images/query-spikes-and-related-queries.png" alt="Query spikes and related queries screenshot"></p>

<p>I was the original designer of the Funnelback "Pattern Analyser" system. This can detect "<a href="http://docs.funnelback.com/pattern_analyser_reports.html">spikes</a>" in the time series query log data, where these spikes are usually caused by some external event (e.g. a news story). I also designed and implemented a system to automatically detect related queries, based on their click patterns. This can be used to group queries which have no terms in common but have the same semantics.</p>

<p>Example visualization of a web crawl:</p>

<p><img src="../images/website-graph.png" alt="Graph visualisation"></p>

<p>I was the original designer and developer of the Funnelback web crawler, which was designed to minimise resource usage (memory, storage etc.) while crawling 100s of millions of web pages. I have also done work on analysing crawl link graphs and how "annotations" like queries, clicks and anchortext can be used to enrich the dataset for other applications (including Analytics and Data Mining).</p>

<h3>
<a name="text-mining" class="anchor" href="#text-mining"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text Mining</h3>

<p>Example of extraction of definitions from text:</p>

<p><img src="../images/text-mining-example.png" alt="Graph visualisation"></p>

<p>I am the creator of a "<a href="http://docs.funnelback.com/text_mining.html">text mining</a>" system which uses syntactic patterns to extract definitions for phrases and acronyms. When those terms are used as a query the definition can be displayed at the top of the search results, with a link back to the page that contained the original definition.</p>
